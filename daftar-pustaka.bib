@misc{Kabir2025,
   abstract = {The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in critical domains, such as healthcare, finance, law, and autonomous systems, has brought unprecedented societal benefits. Its black-box (sub-symbolic) nature allows AI to compute prediction without explaining the rationale to the end user, resulting in lack of transparency between human and machine. Concerns are growing over the opacity of such complex AI models, particularly deep learning architectures. To address this concern, explainability is of paramount importance, which has triggered the emergence of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) as a vital research area. XAI is aimed at enhancing transparency, trust, and accountability of AI models. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of XAI from the dual perspectives of challenges and opportunities. We analyze the foundational concepts, definitions, terminologies, and taxonomy of XAI methods. We then review several application domains of XAI. Special attention is given to various challenges of XAI, such as no universal definition, trade-off between accuracy and interpretability, and lack of standardized evaluation metrics. We conclude by outlining the future research directions of human-centric design, interactive explanation, and standardized evaluation frameworks. This survey serves as a resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to navigate the evolving landscape of interpretable and responsible AI.},
